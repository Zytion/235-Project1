## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
Players will use a series of growning menu buttons to collet resouses, manage the village, level up, and explore.

Players will start by clicking buttons to gather resoures. Once they progress, players will have a building menu that allows them to add new buildings to their villages, unlocking new features like resource processing or trading. Players will have unlock a menu to assign villagers to tasks, once recruited. (Potentially) Once their village is advanced enough players will be able to explore the world and bring back unqiue loot or set up new trade routes. Finally, players will level up as they go, allowing for upgrades and player customization.

### Control
* Mouse
* Touch and/or gesture (Mobile only)
### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
Players will learn gradually as menus are unlocked and features are added. To start players will have very few options for resource gathering and no exploration or management options. As time goes on and they get more experience with the features they have unlocked then the newer features will open up.

### Player learning
Players will need to learn how to manage their time properly. They have to learn what rescourses they need to gather first and what buildings and upgrades they think they need. This will involve learning how to get new villages and allocate their labor effecently.
