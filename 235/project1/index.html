            <p>
                Meat Clicker is a game where you start off with a single resource that you can click to gather to build
                your village into the capital of the world. Once the player has gathered enough meat to gain the
                attention of a worker, they can then allocate that worker to a job that will idly gain resources. You
                can also use certain resources to upgrade the worker's speed and/or worker's output.

                    stone (for structures/upgrades), and ore (upgrades). You will be able to hover over the
                    resources to see how many resources you are getting per tick.
