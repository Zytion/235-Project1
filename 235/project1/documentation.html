            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Day 1</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to base this game's concept and theme off of an old 2008 game called Hinterland. With that in
                mind, I went back and began looking at images of the game and putting together a style (scrolls and
                parchment). For gameplay, I took heavy inspiration from indle games like adarkroom and cookie clicker. I
                want to evolve on these ideas by having events that can occur and maybe trying to adding more of that
                classic text-based adventure feel (things like Orgain trail or Zork).
            </p>
            <h3>Day 2</h3>
            <p>
                I am using Google Drawing to create the look of the menus. It is good at simulating a website look and
                it is helping me nail down the mechanics of the game. I am going to have to cut a lot of the ideas I had
                for the final product, but I am liking the core game here.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 3</h3>
            <p>
                With the images made and a pallet chosen I can begin working on my website. I made a semantic mark-up of
                the HTML content for the proposal page using the online guide and began work on transferring that into
                HTML code.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 4</h3>
            <p>
                I finished most of the HTML work for the proposal page and the home page. I then began work on the CSS
                for the proposal page. My plan is to create the CSS for one page and then make any tweaks I need to get
                it working for the other page. Since I am going to have everything be in one column, I am going to make
                the main container element be a flexbox.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 5</h3>
            <p>
                The only issue I had with the CSS was the images in the screenshots section, but that was easily fixed
                by using a flexbox that wraps. The images now display on a 2x2 grid in full screen and shift to a columb
                format on smaller screens. Besides that, the CSS for the other pages is basically done.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 6</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to change the navbar so that in a smaller screen view it condenses to just the home button. On
                smaller screens, it will now allow the user to hover over the home button to reveal the other pages,
                makes the content more visible. I also added some border-radiuses and a background image to the title to
                make the page look nicer.
            </p>
