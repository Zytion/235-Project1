            <p>
                Hinterworld is a text-based idle game in which players gather resources, build a village, and level up. 
                Players start by gathering resources by clicking on the button to perform the task. Once they build a house
                they can begin to recruite villages to assist them in gathering resources. As the player progresses they will unlock
                new upgrades, buildings, resources, and improvements for their village.
