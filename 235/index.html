			<h1><em>Your Game Name</em></h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>I. High Concept</h2>
				<p>An incremental, role-playing game about gathering resourses, building a village, and leveling skills</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>II. Genre</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Incremental</li>
                     <li>Role Playing</li>
                     <li>Idle Game</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>III. Platform</h2>
				<p>Universal?</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>IV. Story</h2>
				<p>You were exiled from you village and forced to leave for the wilderness. 
					After weeks of travel you have found a clearning near a stream that looks perfect for the start of a new village.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
				<p>Graphics style: Abstract</p>
				<p>Sound: 8-bit</p>
				<p>This game will have a song or two playing on loop</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>Players will use a series of growning menu buttons to collet resouses, manage the village, level up, and explore.</p>
		
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mouse</li>
					<li>Touch and/or gesture (Mobile only)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
				<p>Players will learn gradually as menus are unlocked and features are added. To start players will have very few options for resource gathering
					and no exploration or management options. As time goes on and they get more experience with the features they
				</p>
			
				<h3>Player learning</h3>
				<p>Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about <i>depth</i> - which is simply (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."</p>
				
			</section>
			
			
			<section>
				<h2>VII. Screenshots</h2>
				<p>Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop mockups, or scanned <a href="http://gamestorm.tumblr.com">doodles</a>  - use  &lt;img&gt; tags. You can either display the images in this section, or somewhere else on the page.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>VIII. Other</h2>
				<p>Something else you'd like to say that doesn't fit elsewhere. Also discuss any external libraries you might use. All libraries are subject to Professor approval.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>IX. About the developer(s)</h2>
				<p>Your name/major/minor/year your, skill set and interests (ex. programming, game physics, graphic design, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, music, game sound, ...).</p>

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p><b>Overview:</b> Create a living proposal for a 2D casual game you will develop.</p>
			<p>"Living proposal" means that the document will be a starting point, but the content will evolve as you work on the game.</p>
			
			<p><b>Quotes of interest:</b> <em>Why make a plan?</em></p>
		
			<p><q>In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.</q> - <cite>Dwight Eisenhower</cite></p>
			<p><q>Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.</q> - <cite>Dwight Eisenhower</cite></p>
			<p><q>Fail to plan, plan to fail.</q> - <cite>Hillary Clinton</cite></p>
			<p><q>I'm not making any plans. I'm just going to let the universe surprise me.</q> - <cite>John Cusack</cite> (Don't listen to him for this project)</p>
			
			
			<p><b>Important:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the template in the first part of this document, or an equivalent. The page will be visible at : <code>http://people.rit.edu/yourid/590-ios-game/project-1-proposal.html</code> or on your own server if you wish. Submission: post online, and ZIP and post (HTML &amp; images) to dropbox before due date. Be sure to put actual URL to the online version in the mycourses dopbox comments field.</li>
				<li>Don't overscope this! Be sure it's something you could create a reasonable implementation of in JS in 2-1/2 weeks or so. Not every feature you come up with will have to be in the final game, but the core gameplay should be.</li>
				<li>We've a covered chain reaction game, a simple mobile game, and a sprite shooter in this class, but don't feel constrained to these generes.
				Platformers, puzzle games, tile-based games, and many other genres are possible. You may have to avail yourself of online tutorials - that's fine - just be sure to cite resources - and do your own coding in the final version.</li>
				<li>Teams of 2 are acceptable for this project. You will need to make sure that both of your names are on the proposal, and you will both need to upload the proposal to mycourses and gibson. Team projects will be held to a higher standard on the grading.</li>
				<li>A simple idea that is well-executed is better than an over-scoped and under-realized concept.</li>
				<li>This is a new course, so I don't have a large bank of HTML5 game projects to show you, but there are some great tutorials and examples online. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=html5+platfromer+tutorial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#q=html5+platformer+tutorial&amp;rls=en&amp;spell=1">Google: html5 platformer tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=html5+platfromer+tutorial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#q=html5+match+3+game+tutorial&amp;rls=en">Google: html5 match 3 game tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=html5+platfromer+tutorial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#q=html5+tile+based+game+tutorial&amp;rls=en">Google: html5 tile based game tutorial</a></li>

				<li>The game should be fun. Flappy Birds clones need not apply.</li>

			<p><em>** Discussion from Project 0 **</em></p>
			
			<p><b>Definition:</b> What's a Casual game? Most casual games have similar basic features: (1)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Extremely simple gameplay, like a puzzle game that can be played entirely using a one-button mouse or cellphone keypad</li>
				<li>Allowing gameplay in short bursts, during work breaks or, in the case of portable and cell phone games, on public transportation</li>
				<li>The ability to quickly reach a final stage, or continuous play with no need to save the game</li>
				<li>Some variant on a "try before you buy" business model or an advertising-based model</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Other Common Characteristics:</b> (2)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Average play sessions of 2 to 5 minutes</li>
				<li>Overall game length a few hours</li>
				<li>Depth of gameplay is emphasized over length - a small number elements are re-combined in unique ways. ex. Plants v. Zombies.</li>
				<li>Repeatability is emphasized over content. Short and exciting play sessions to encourage the player to give it "just one more try"</li>
				<li>Natural play breaks built into game.</li>
				<li>Variety and surprise are  built into the game.</li>
			</ul>
